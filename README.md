# Beer Label Competition

For many years, Gr8Conf has brewed custom beers for the participants.
And the beers have had custom labels, designed by the conference organisers (Søren, actually).

This year, we will try to crowd source some of this!

Please submit your creative designs for beer labels and win immortal fame by having your design be the chosen one!

## Guidelines
The sky's the limit! As long as the sky fits on a beer bottle.

### Minimum Requirements
Your design must include the GR8Conf logo and should leave room for adding the alcohol percentage and the beer type (IPA, Lager, Ale etc).

GR8Conf logos can be found here: https://github.com/GR8ConfEU/gr8logos

### Formats
Submissions must be designed to be printed on a 67 x 97 mm rectangular label, good quality (600 dpi). 
Thus, at least 1500x2300 pixels. Please submit in a common format (JPG, PNG, SVG, PDF or AI). 
If we can't open it, we can't use it. 

### Content restrictions
Keep it safe-for-work. For the scope of this, Fortran is deemed safe-for-work. Cobol is an edge case.
Please don't use other people's copyrighted materials.

### Licensing
By submitting your design, you give GR8Conf the legal rights to use it and/or modify it without any compensation to you. 
You still keep your copyright, but the conference can use it in any form. We suggest that you use https://creativecommons.org/licenses
Attribution-ShareAlike license.

## Inspiration

For inspiration, here are some of the previous years' designs.

And here's a gallery of some labels other brewers have made: https://brygselv.dk/etiketter/
(Some of these would *NOT* be acceptable under our restrictions and are NSFW) 
 
## How to submit

Fork the repo, add your label as a subfolder under the "labels" folder and make a pull request - e.g.
  `labels/My great design/MyLabel.png` and `labels/My great design/comments.md`

We will accept the pull request, unless it violates the guidelines. 

### Deadline
We must have your submission by April 1 - we will then choose a winner based on coolness, nerdiness, groovy relevance 
and whatever strikes our fancy. If there are a lot of submissions, we might even organize a quick vote.

### Prize
We will use at least one of the submitted designs, but possibly more. The prize is yet to be determined, but _may_ have a 
value of up to 1 Million Euro! 

(Note that a bottle of beer with your design *may* have a value of *up to* 1 Million Euro, 
since it *may* end up as a collectors item - who knows?)

# But wait, there's more!


## Back labels

We will try to print back labels as well - smaller labels for the back of the bottle.
Feel free to submit anything here - code fragments, URLs of your favourite open source projects, groovy puzzlers, 
elevator pitch for your new Base64-based cryptocurrency, ...
(Almost) anything goes.

We will try to get these printed individually and put randomly on the back of the bottles. So if we have 200 bottles and get 50 submitted back labels, each will end up on four bottles.   

This is a bit experimental, so let's see how it goes.

To submit a back label, either tweet using the #GR8beer tag or make a push request to the "backlabels" directory.
If you have a design in mind, the same format and content restrictions as above applies, but you don't need to make room for the alcohol percentage or
the type of beer. And to lower the confusion, try to not make it look like a beer label. However, you are also welcome to submit just a few lines of text or a quote and we'll handle the formatting.

# Ladies and Gentlemen, you may start your imaginations!
